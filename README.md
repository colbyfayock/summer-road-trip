### Configuring Your Road Trip

#### Updating the name
In `gatsby-config.js`, you can update the `title` and the `githubUrl`. Doing this will update the the header of our road trip site.

#### Updating the trip locations
In `src/data/locations.js`, you can add, remove, or update the objects inside of the `locations` object.

The `image` property isn't required, but to utilize it, you can either import a local image like in the starter or you  can use a URL to an external file.
